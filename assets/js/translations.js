Our name is inspired by his powerful philosophical poem, which centers on the destiny of the Ukrainian nation and its struggle for freedom. The work explores the complex relationship between a leader and the people, touching upon themes of betrayal, doubt, faith in the spirit's strength, and the inevitability of national revival despite all trials. This deep connection to the Ukrainian soul is the foundation of our identity.",

Назва натхненна його філософською поемою, що розповідає про долю українського народу та його боротьбу за свободу. Вона досліджує складні відносини між провідником і народом, торкається тем зради, сумніву, віри у силу духу та неминучого відродження нації попри всі випробування.
